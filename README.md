# simple-calculator
 A type of simple calculator, created to test some own points of knowledge acquired so far.
This simple calculator was created using only basic conditional commands. Like "if", "elif" and "else".
Made also with the purpose of evaluating my knowledge as a programming student.

Note 1: The last update was made using the use of lists, for storage of possible entries (1.1.0).

Note 2: The use of the While loop was used for the script to continue running (1.1.1).
